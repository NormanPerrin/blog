For all these places, I don't recommend being there for more than 2 hours—they are not designed for that—then going on a weekday is better than on a weekend, and during the morning.

Here are some places I found nice (in order):

1. [Gorrión (Saavedra)](https://goo.gl/maps/F4VJiLeaZST6QPoQ8): Really nice food and coffee, also it's located in a quiet area.
1. [Big Rabbit](https://goo.gl/maps/onWAny6MDLxydor99): Awesome coffee and food, a bit small. Be sure to go early.
1. [Le Pain Quotidien (Olivos)](https://goo.gl/maps/ZmAS7sNKFNqkift69): As with every Le Pain Quotidien, it get crowded after lunch, they have good food and it's nice overall.
1. [Le Pain Quotidien (Belgrano)](https://goo.gl/maps/F3oEAUjNjAeakYCf9): Same as above but in a more crowded place.
1. [El puntal de Nuñez](https://goo.gl/maps/W5G9Rbu2cZykzXcC8): Not an ideal place to work, but if you're like you'll be glad to hear they open at 7 am.
1. [Work Café Recoleta](https://goo.gl/maps/kV3mmSDG2wcYN6Hc9): I'm not sure if not being a client of Santander is a problem, but it's an OK place to go work.

As there are many Starbucks places to recommend, not to eat but to work, here are the ones I find quietest:

1. [Starbucks (Serrano)](https://goo.gl/maps/HRh7DncREwJNPT546)
1. [Starbucks (Olivos)](https://goo.gl/maps/n9ZFfF61qqgqWGvt8)
1. [Starbucks (Jean Jaures)](https://goo.gl/maps/JwmzPd9w8Jx4SjCv5)

I know nowadays there are many new coffee shops to visit, I looked that they opened lots of Le Pain Quotidien locals as well. If you have any recommendations, please let me know!
